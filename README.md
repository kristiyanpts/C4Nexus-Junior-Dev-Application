# Clothing Store
This small project was a task from C4 Nexus for the position Junior Dev. It has 3 product listing pages and uses mock data just for testing purposes. It is responsive so you can use it from any device.

It consists of 3 product listing pages (angular components) which are located in the the categories folder. All of them use two other components inside of them. The first one being the filters, which has a directive to set the available colors for filtering, and the second one being the actual listing page, which also has 2 directives - first one accepting all of the products from that category and the second one being just some header information.
